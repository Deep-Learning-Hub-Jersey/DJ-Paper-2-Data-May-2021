(ii) It shall be a swap disclosure event (\"Swap Disclosure Event\") if, on any Business Day after the date hereof, the Depositor notifies UBS AG the Significance Percentage has reached one of the thresholds for significance of derivative contracts set forth in Item 1115 of Regulation AB (based on a reasonable determination by the Depositor, in good faith and using the Calculation Methodology, of such Significance Percentage). (iii) Upon the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event, UBS AG, at its own expense, shall (a) provide to the Depositor the applicable Swap Financial Disclosure (as defined below), (b) secure another entity to replace UBS AG as party to this Agreement on terms substantially similar to this Agreement and subject to prior notification to the Swap Rating Agencies, which entity (or a guarantor therefor) meets or exceeds the Approved Rating Thresholds (or which satisfies the Rating Agency Condition) and which entity is able to provide the appropriate Swap Financial Disclosure or (c) obtain a guaranty of UBS AG\\'s obligations under this Agreement from an affiliate of UBS AG that is able to comply with the financial information disclosure requirements of Item 1115 of Regulation AB, such that disclosure provided in respect of the affiliate will, in the judgment of counsel to the Depositor, satisfy any disclosure requirements applicable to the Swap Provider, cause such affiliate to provide Swap Financial Disclosure and cause such affiliate to provide indemnity for the Swap Financial Disclosure that is reasonably acceptable to the Depositor. If permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure may be provided by reference to or incorporation by reference from reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act. (iv) UBS AG agrees that, in the event that UBS AG provides Swap Financial Disclosure to the Depositor in accordance with paragraph (iii)(a) above, or causes its affiliate to provide Swap Financial Disclosure to the Depositor in accordance with paragraph (iii)(c) above, it will indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, its respective directors or officers and any person controlling the Depositor, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (any \"Damage\") caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Swap Financial Disclosure or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state in such Swap Financial Disclosure a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however that the foregoing shall not apply to any Damage caused by the negligence or any willful action of the Depositor or any other party (other than UBS AG or any of its affiliates or any of their respective agents), including without limitation any failure to calculate the Significance Percentage according to the terms of this Agreement or to make any filing as and when required under Regulation AB. (v) In the event that UBS AG provides the information referred to above, such information shall be provided not later than five (5) business days prior to the date in which the Master Servicer is required to file a Form 10-D for such Distribution Date. For the purposes hereof: \"Calculation Methodology\" means such method for determining maximum probable exposure of a derivative contract as reasonably determined by the Depositor. \"Swap Financial Disclosure\" means the financial information specified in Item 1115 of Regulation AB relating to the applicable Significance Percentage and any necessary auditors consents relating to such financial information. Additional Termination Events: The following Additional Termination Events will apply to UBS AG: 1. Ratings Event. If a Ratings Event (as defined below) has occurred and UBS AG has not complied with the requirements set forth in the succeeding paragraph within the 30 day time period specified therein, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG and UBS AG shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such an Additional Termination Event. Rating Agency Downgrade: If a Ratings Event occurs with respect to UBS AG, then UBS AG shall, at its own expense, (i) assign this Transaction hereunder to a third party within thirty (30) days of such Ratings Event that meets or exceeds, or as to which any applicable credit support provider meets or exceeds, the Approved Rating Threshold (as defined below) on terms substantially similar to this Confirmation or (ii) deliver collateral acceptable in a form and amount acceptable to Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\") and Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. (\"Moody\\'s) within thirty (30) days of such Ratings Event and subject to written confirmation from Fitch and Moody\\'s that delivery of such collateral in the context of such downgrade will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of the then current ratings assigned to the Certificates. For the avoidance of doubt, a downgrade of the rating on Wells Fargo Mortgage Backed Securities 2006-6 Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-6, Class I-A-22 (the \"Certificates\") could occur in the event that UBS AG does not post sufficient collateral. For purposes of this Transaction, a \"Ratings Event\" shall occur with respect to UBS AG if its long term unsecured debt rating (the \"Long Term Rating\") ceases to be rated at least \"A1\" by Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc. or at least \"A+ by Fitch Ratings (such ratings being referred to as the \"Approved Ratings Threshold\"), (unless, within 30 days after such withdrawal or downgrade Fitch and Moody\\'s have reconfirmed the rating of the Certificates which were in effect immediately prior to such withdrawal or downgrade). 2. Swap Disclosure Event. If upon the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event (as defined in paragraph (xxiii) above), UBS AG has not, within 5 business days after such Swap Disclosure Event complied with any of the provisions set forth in paragraph (xxiii) above, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG with UBS AG as the sole Affected Party with respect to such Additional Termination Event. Transfer, Amendment and Assignment: No transfer, amendment, waiver, supplement, assignment or other modification of this Transaction (other than the pledge of this Transaction to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall be permitted by either party unless Moody\\'s and Fitch have been provided notice of the same and confirm in writing (including by facsimile transmission) that they will not downgrade, qualify, withdraw or otherwise modify its then-current rating of the Certificates; provided however that except with respect to a transfer at the direction of UBS, nothing in this provision shall impose any obligation on UBS to give notice to any rating agency. Permitted Security Interest: For purposes of Section 7 of the Agreement, UBS AG hereby consents to the Permitted Security Interest. \"Permitted Security Interest\" means the collateral assignment by the Counterparty of the Cap Collateral to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the granting to the Master Servicer of a security interest in the Cap Collateral pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. \"Cap Collateral\" means all right, title and interest of the Counterparty in this Agreement, each Transaction hereunder, and all present and future amounts payable by UBS AG to the Counterparty under or in connection with the Agreement or any Transaction governed by the Agreement, whether or not evidenced by a Confirmation, including, without limitation, any transfer or termination of any such Transaction.
