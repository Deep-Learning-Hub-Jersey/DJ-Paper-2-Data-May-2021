    "Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them specifically for the pre-trained model that we are using. Even though we have already tokenized and split our words into a list, each model will have it's own further method of tokenization to match the dictionary for each specific model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by a 🤗 Transformers Tokenizer which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method, which will ensure:\n",
    " - we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,\n",
    " - we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.\n",
    " \n",
    "The exception here is for Roberta Base where we specifically call the tokenizer for this model, due to inconsistencies in the Hugging Face library for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, as is the case here, inputs have already been split into words,we pass the list of words to the tokenzier with the argument \"is_split_into_words=True\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tokens will be split into subtokens if the token is not in the model dictionary. This means that we need to do some processing on our labels as the input ids returned by the tokenizer are longer than the lists of labels our dataset contain, first because some special tokens might be added (eg a [CLS] and a [SEP]) and then because of those possible splits of words in multiple tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tokenizers returns outputs that have a word_ids method which can help us. Otherwise we have to build our own, as is the case for DeBERTa for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will return a list with the same number of elements as our processed input ids, mapping special tokens to None and all other tokens to their respective word. This way, we can align the labels with the processed input ids.\n",

    "Here we set the labels of all special tokens to -100 (the index that is ignored by PyTorch) and the labels of all other tokens to the label of the word they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy is to set the label only on the first token obtained from a given word, and give a label of -100 to the other subtokens from the same word. Just change the value of the following flag : \"label_all_tokens = True/False\""
